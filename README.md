# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

The objective of this application is to generate random passwords to users. 
Using javascript, I was able to create a function that generates a random password to the user based on the user's preferences (input). 
This was an opportunity for me to deploy my understanding of javascript into a functional tool.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

After clicking the generate password button, the window would prompt a series of steps to the user that include password length and types of characters (uppercase,lowercase, numbers , and special characters). Based on the user's input a random password would be then generated as a window alert.
